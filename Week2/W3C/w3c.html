                The W3C mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and

                The World Wide Web Consortium achieves its mission by bringing diverse stake-holders together, 
                under a clear and effective consensus-based process to develop high-quality standards based on 
                contributions from the W3C Members, staff, and the community at large.

            W3C Staff and Working Group participants are among the world's experts in Web technologies and their impacts. 
            We will help put you in touch with these experts to answer questions on Web technologies, Web standards, and the 
            way W3C does its work. The W3C Communications Team welcomes your questions and requests.

            Ensuring that the Web remains open, accessible and interoperable for everyone around the world is a mission that the 
            World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) takes to heart every day. While some of the technical work we do receives funding from 
            Member organizations, we are only able to achieve Web inventor Tim Berners-Leeâ€™s vision of leading the Web to its full 
            potential through the generosity of contributions and sponsorships from individuals and organizations.

                W3C Fellows are employees of Member organizations who join the W3C Team for specific projects and usually a predetermined 
                duration. W3C encourages Member organizations to participate. From time to time, W3C looks for motivated people to join the 
                W3C Team. The Team provides technical leadership about Web technologies, organizes and manages W3C activities to reach goals 
                within practical constraints (such as resources available), and communicates with the Members and the public about the Web 
                and W3C technologies. W3C is unique among standards bodies for its full-time staff of Web experts.
